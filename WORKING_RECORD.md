# Garnet Guard working record

Current state, open tasks, verification and review dispositions. Newest first.

## 2026-10-27: GitHub Action re-landed on main

**State.** PR #5 (the Action) was merged into `lockfiles/garnet-check` after PR #6 had already merged, so `action.yml`, `action/` and `garnet_guard.markdown` never reached `main`. This entry's PR replays #5's three commits onto `main` unchanged; the files match #5's final version. The Action runs `garnet check`, which is now on `main`.

**Verification.** `uv run pytest` (110 tests), ruff, mypy (strict), `lint-imports`, shellcheck and zizmor (offline) pass. The Action itself has not run on GitHub yet.

## 2026-10-10: GitHub Action preview

**State.** The Action and its comment are built on top of `garnet check` (PR #6):

- `action.yml` at the repository root (Marketplace needs it there; API.md §9 shows `action/`), with scripts in `action/`.
- `action/comment/`: the `workflow_run` comment job for forks.
- `action/examples/`: the single workflow, plus the two-workflow pair for forks.
- `garnet_guard.markdown`: the SPEC §9.4 comment, rendered from the JSON report.
- `docs/action.md` (usage) and `docs/marketplace.md` (listing steps).

**Verification.**
- `uv run pytest`: unit tests pass with no network. `tests/test_action.py` runs the shell scripts against a local git repository, with `uv` and `gh` stubbed.
- ruff, mypy (strict), `lint-imports`, shellcheck, actionlint and zizmor all pass. zizmor's only findings are the `<release-commit-sha>` placeholders in the examples.
- The Action itself has not run on GitHub yet.
- Independent review found six issues, all fixed: the renderer could import a module from the pull request checkout (`python -m` puts the working directory on `sys.path`); a bad report in the fork comment job left the old comment up; a stale report could be reused; long SHAs could still autolink; fork comments looked independent; the git auth header was on argv. A symlinked lockfile is now refused too.
- No `policy` input: `garnet check` doesn't read policy files in this preview.

**Open questions.**
- The comment's passing-update column says "no findings" where the mock shows "provenance ✓ · tag ✓ · content ✓". A report doesn't record which checks ran clean, so the mock's wording would claim more than Garnet Guard knows.
- Rule links point to `docs/rules/<ID>.md` in the repository, not garnet-guard.dev, until a domain is registered.

## 2026-10-10: CI and release pipeline

**State.** `.github/workflows/` has CI (`ci.yml`), the OpenSSF Scorecard (`scorecard.yml`) and a tag-triggered release (`release.yml`) that publishes with Trusted Publishing and PEP 740 attestations, then verifies them from PyPI. Dependabot watches GitHub Actions and the uv lockfile with a 7-day cooldown. All actions are pinned by commit SHA and every job declares minimal permissions.

**Open tasks.** The one-time PyPI and GitHub settings in docs/RELEASING.md (pending trusted publisher, `pypi` environment, tag and branch rulesets). Nothing can publish until they exist. CI runs on Linux only; macOS and Windows (SPEC §11) are a follow-up once the tests are checked there.

**Verification.** actionlint and zizmor pass on the workflows (zizmor: one low "self-repository" note, kept as `./` syntax). The CI commands pass locally, including tests on Python 3.14, `uv build --no-sources` and the wheel smoke test. The workflows themselves first run on this PR.

## 2026-10-10: repository seeded, `garnet diff` preview

**State.** The repository is seeded from the founding documents and contains the 0.1 preview engine:

- `garnet diff <pkg> <old> <new>` for PyPI
- `garnet explain` and `garnet version`
- text and JSON reports

**Rules implemented:**
- GRN-T001 to T005, T007, T008
- GRN-C001 to C003
- GRN-K001
- GRN-E001 to E003

**Verification.**
- `uv run pytest`: 38 unit tests pass with no network.
- `uv run ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`, `mypy src` (strict) and `lint-imports` all pass.
- `uv run python -m backtest`:
  - Replays lightning 2.6.2 and 2.6.3, each caught by GRN-C003 and GRN-T004.
  - Replays elementary-data 0.23.3, caught by GRN-C001. GRN-T004 fires only against today's tags: the attacker's `v0.23.3` tag existed on the day and was deleted later.
  - Replays litellm 1.82.7 (GRN-C003) and 1.82.8 (GRN-C001, GRN-C003), and telnyx 4.87.1 and 4.87.2 (GRN-C003, GRN-T004).
  - Replays the deleted malicious files by URL and hash from files.pythonhosted.org.
  - The 20 clean updates in `backtest/clean.toml` produce no warnings from detection rules.
- Known-bad lookups are off in the backtest on purpose, to show what Garnet Guard catches before any feed lists a release.

**Caveats.**
- GRN-T001 can't fire on these incidents, because neither project attested releases before the attack.
- GRN-T004 is evaluated against the tags as they stood at upload: today's tags with the changes recorded in `backtest/incidents.toml` (`tags_on_the_day`). Tag changes nobody recorded aren't modelled.

**Open tasks (month 1, see ROADMAP.md):**
- lockfile parsers and `garnet check`
- policy file
- cache
- intermediate versions (SPEC §5 rule 2)
- SARIF output
- per-change time budget
- fuzz tests for `safe_archive.py`
- CI workflow with pinned Actions
- approach-check notes

**Review dispositions.** None yet.
